### The Core Finding

**Bookface succeeds because of its MEMBERSHIP model, not its features.**

| Aspect | Bookface | Generic Social Media |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Who joins** | YC founders only (verified) | Anyone |
| **Why they join** | Trust + shared context | Vanity/FOMO |
| **What they discuss** | Real problems (private) | Performative posts (public) |
| **How it's moderated** | YC team (quality standard) | Algorithms (engagement-optimized) |
| **Success metric** | Useful, honest discussions | Viral reach |

### Your Design Challenge

Build a **trust-based community platform** that:
- ✅ Makes discovery frictionless (directory)
- ✅ Supports dual profiles (personal + company)
- ✅ Organizes by cohort/batch (sub-communities)
- ✅ Emphasizes quality over engagement (no vanity metrics)
- ✅ Provides professional tools (messaging, jobs, deals)

**NOT:** A generic social feed or another LinkedIn.

## 🎯 Key Questions to Answer Before Designing

Answer these **6 questions** before you start building:

### 1. **Membership**
- Who gets access? (Geography? Stage? Industry?)
- How are they verified? (Manual? Domain? API?)
- What's your trust signal? (Founder status? Batch/cohort?)

### 2. **Content Curation**
- Will you curate content (playbooks, guides)?
- Or just community discussions?
- How do you prevent monoculture?

### 3. **Moderation**
- Who moderates? (You? Community? Combination?)
- What are your rules? (Be explicit—document it.)
- How fast do you respond to spam?

### 4. **Batch/Cohort**
- Do your members have batches/cohorts?
- How do you define them?
- How central are they to identity?

### 5. **Professional Tools**
- Which matter most? (Jobs? Deals? Scheduling? All?)
- MVP first, or all at once?

### 6. **Scale Plan**
- How many members at launch?
- How fast do you grow?
- When do you close/stabilize membership?

## 🚫 What NOT to Build (Common Mistakes)

Don't add these—they're anti-Bookface:

- ❌ Public like counts (quality > engagement)
- ❌ Share/retweet mechanics (discourages honest discussion)
- ❌ Influencer profiles (kills trust-based community)
- ❌ Monetization (kills moderation objectivity)
- ❌ Anonymous posting (breaks trust model)

## 💡 Key Insight You Should Remember

> **Bookface succeeds NOT because of its features, but because of its membership.**

If you:
- ✅ Define clear membership criteria
- ✅ Build a shared context (all founders)
- ✅ Establish trust through curation
- ✅ Enforce quality standards
- ✅ Provide professional tools

**...then the specific features matter much less.**

Focus on getting the community right first. The features support that, not the reverse.
